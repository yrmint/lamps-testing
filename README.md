# Lamps testing
        
Among N light bulbs, part r is faulty. Each time, m light bulbs are randomly selected and checked to see how many of them are working. This program guesses the number of faulty light bulbs. 
        
## Part 1a
After each test, a series of posterior probability distributions of hypotheses about the number of faulty light bulbs is calculated. The corresponding results are presented visually on a graph in the form of changes in probability distribution diagrams of hypotheses over the course of experiments.
      
## Part 1b
After each attempt, it is determined which hypotheses have the highest probability. The evolution of changes in the most probable hypotheses is visualized.
        
## Part 1c
The dependence of the number of prevailing hypotheses on the number of experiments performed is constructed.
